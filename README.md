# Online Assembler & Dissassembler
Online assembler/disassembler based on Keystone.js and Capstone.js

# Why?
I previously used these two online services a lot - [#1](https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm) and [#2](http://shell-storm.org/online/Online-Assembler-and-Disassembler/). Just recently I stumbled with Keystone.js and Capstone.js, and I thought it might be a good idea to create a nice web page around these two libraries.

Feel free to use or update the code. Any bug fixes is highly appreciated!
